Submission for final project of Getting and Cleaning Data
run_analysis.R is a script that combines the test and training data of the 
provided UCI HAR Dataset, subsets to only mean and standard deviation variables,
and appends subject and activity values. The final data table is complete_tbl.

This script assumes the provided archive was extracted from the root project
directory and preserves the original directory tree.
